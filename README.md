# Vulkan Framework (Untitled)

The goal of this project is to provide a modern, expandable platform for vulkan development.

## Features
* Shader reflection, along with utilities that automate VkPipelineLayout creation

## Planned
* I want a 1 step build process. Currently, I believe its 2 step, install vulkan, and run cmake (cmake pulls glfw and spirvcross)
* Ideally, I'd like this to be usable as a C API with other languages, but I have no idea what that looks like at this moment
* and more!

## Dependencies
The goal is to be as bare minimum as possible. 
* Vulkan
* GLFW
* Spirv-Cross
